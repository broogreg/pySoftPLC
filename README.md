# pySoftPLC 

pySoftPLC is a simplified SoftPLC being developed to aide in the instruction of beginning PLC programmers.
Initially I will limit the I/O to be only digital with a limit of 255 inputs and 255 outputs. 
The I/O can be accessed by talking to an external Modbus Server.

pySoftPLC is using libraries from [MBLogic](http://mblogic.sourceforge.net/index.html) Which is a massive project that covers the full spectrum of control.
MBLogic was developed using python 2 and as far as I can tell hasn't been updated since 2011.  If anyone knows otherwise, please let me know.

The plan is to keep it as simple as possible. So that emphasis can be place on learning how PLCs work and not learning Python.

The project is free software and is licensed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007. See the gpl-3.0.txt file.
